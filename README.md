# CubeCart_Net_30
Net 30 payment module for CubeCart v6

***IMPORTANT*** This module does NOT accept payments - it allows specified customers to place orders without paying under the assumption that you have previously negotiated payment terms with the customer, e.g. Net-30 terms.

Determining a customer's credit trustworthiness, sending invoices and receiving payments for goods sold is the sole responsibility of the CubeCart-powered site's owner(s) or operator(s).
